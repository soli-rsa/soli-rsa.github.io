## Preface

To my beloved Nobuhle Zwane.

I wrote this journal with the constant internal battle of whether I'd ever show it to you. I have no planned structure of "scope" of what the pages will contain, but I can guarantee you that they will be a dive into my deepest thoughts of you (both imaginary and real).

I also hope to use these pages to better improve my skills as a writer. So all these words will be pure, without the aid of my *9000 nerdy keyboards*, no autocorrect and no changes in grammar. Just pure rich text.

I want to apologize for any pain that may stem from these documents because I don't know what lies ahead.

I hope you come to value these pages as I do.

From your lover, now and always ❤

Soli Tsaagane

### NOT OFF TO A GOOD START

Earlier on today, you were in good spirits but anxious about your trip with the girls. It seemed like a beautiful summer evening in China and your beauty was radiating in your space as you were packing.

I was rather moody and quite in need of your attention. This resulted in me ruining both of our moods. I failed to keep my negative energy off you and introduced a degree of unnecessary pain into our lives so I write this to you in order to ask for your forgiveness.

I made you stay up and wait for me. Only for me not to pitch up again. "I was at work...🤷‍♂️" yes, I know but the fact that i couldn't make yet another one of our commitments is an illness to me. 

I thought of punishing myself and staying up until you wake up but then quickly remembered that doesn't do neither of us any good. Instead I chose to take that time and throw it into something creative, something that is unapologetically about the two of us but most importantly **something that reminds me of you**.

*This is my first time writing to you and it frustrates me that I'm starting off with an apology.*

### DELIVERY DAY

"**IT'S FINALLY HERE!**", she exclaimed as she rushed into our entertainment room. The energy of her anticipation lights up the room as she halts to do her signature celebration dance. I pause my game and put down the PS5 controller to marvel at the festivities.

"What's finally here my love?", I ask jokingly knowing exactly what's happening. I'm met with an unshakeable feeling of pride towards her accomplishiment.

"**MY BABY!!!**", she responds at the the top of her voice. She runs over to me and starts pulling me by the arm. "My love, woza. You'll finish your game later", she says as  she continues to tug at my torso.

"Kanti, whose baby is this? Why are you disturbing me?" I reply chuckling. Only to be met by the cutest and most intimidating stare ever to be witnessed on Earth. I quickly realise that's my cue to get up and attend to the situation.

"Did they call? How far are they?", I ask.

"Coming up the driveway", she replies as we walk towards the front door. She swings open the door and rushes out as we are met by the noise and light of a large white truck.

The delivery guys slowly start to offload R3.8 million worth of german metal with an obsidian black finish. It stood confidently on top of 4, 22 inch cross-spoked tires and the interior was trimmed in open-pore ash wood.

I took a moment to assess her reaction and her happiness quickly became the center of my world. She looked back at me and asked, "Should we take it for a ride?"

To which I responded, "Only if you ride me in it. 😜"

### AN UNFULFILLED AFFIRMATION

When I was in matric in 2012, my outgoing personality (and arguably my lack of motivation from the academic system) nearly resulted in me failing the academic year. The reason behind my lack of motivation was due to the fact that I was spending a large amount of my free time kindling my aspirations of entrepreneurship. I was learning the technicalities of music, computing and virtually every other study that I currently have knowledge of.

If I remember correctly, it was 24th June when I had finished a personal growth workbook and seminar by Bob Proctor about the law of attraction. I was incredibly motivated so I took it upon myself to practice one of the growth tools provided. 

The task was simple, to write a positive mantra that I could repeat until it was imprinted in my subconscious mind.

On that day, I wrote down the following words:

> *"I, Tlhapane Solomon Tsaagane, vow to acquire my first R1 million by the age of 22. In return for this acquisition, I will share my musical talents as well as my academic traits with the world."*

I dated and signed this affirmation and it stayed on my wall until I left for Johannesburg in 2016. I didn't achieve my goal, but I still have unshakeable faith that God has not denied me of attainment.

With my birthday coming up, I think that it is fitting that I update this affirmation and resume this practice. I don't think we've ever discussed this. I'm curious to find out what you have to say about this decision.

### SHOWER TIME

After settling into a beautiful rented space for a romantic week away in the Seychelles. Our travels have left us sticky from the humid, 28 degree african weather with no chance of precipitation. 

We are both well-rested but we just need to refresh. It takes nothing more than a unspoken thought and a glimpse of your smile for the blood in my body to move from one head to another.

You slowly take off every item of clothing on you right in front of me and drop them right where you stand. You then proceed to help me take of mine. 

***MY BREATHING RISES.***

After the most tropically amorous kiss we've ever shared, you command me to follow you in the shower with just the stroke of a finger. The submission triggers an arousal that makes me throb with immediate effect. 

***MY MEMBER RISES.***

As the water touches our skin to make a spritzer of our love, I feel your eagerness for me to be inside you. You lay your hands on my member and...

***MY TEMPERATURE RISES.***
