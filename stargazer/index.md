## Preface

To my beloved Nobuhle Zwane.

I wrote this journal with the constant internal battle of whether I'd ever show it to you. I have no planned structure of "scope" of what the pages will contain, but I can guarantee you that they will be a dive into my deepest thoughts of you (both imaginary and real).

I also hope to use these pages to better improve my skills as a writer. So all these words will be pure, without the aid of my *9000 nerdy keyboards*, no autocorrect and no changes in grammar. Just pure rich text.

I want to apologize for any pain that may stem from these documents because I don't know what lies ahead.

I hope you come to value these pages as I do.

From your lover, now and always ‚ù§

Soli Tsaagane

### NOT OFF TO A GOOD START

Earlier on today, you were in good spirits but anxious about your trip with the girls. It seemed like a beautiful summer evening in China and your beauty was radiating in your space as you were packing.

I was rather moody and quite in need of your attention. This resulted in me ruining both of our moods. I failed to keep my negative energy off you and introduced a degree of unnecessary pain into our lives so I write this to you in order to ask for your forgiveness.

I made you stay up and wait for me. Only for me not to pitch up again. "I was at work...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" yes, I know but the fact that i couldn't make yet another one of our commitments is an illness to me. 

I thought of punishing myself and staying up until you wake up but then quickly remembered that doesn't do neither of us any good. Instead I chose to take that time and throw it into something creative, something that is apologetically about the two of us but most importantly **something that reminds me of you**.

*This is my first time writing to you and it frustrates me that I'm starting off with an apology.*
